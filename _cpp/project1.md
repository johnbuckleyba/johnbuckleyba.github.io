The aim of this project is to create three dynamic images of a mountain biker in action on a trail. The images are intended for publication in a monthly mountain bike magazine such as [mbr.co.uk](http://mbr.co.uk) or [Mountain Biking UK](http://mbuk.com) and will be suitable for editorial content.

There are broadly two types of images commonly used to represent mountain biking. Both types can be used in an editorial or advertising context.

1. A close-up image of a rider. Usually flash is used to fill shadows and highlight the rider. In this class of image the focus is on the rider, the bike and associated gear, along with the style, technique or skill being displayed by the rider. Images are usually dynamic, with the rider in full flow through a turn or jump etc. Although the terrain is visible in this class of image it provides context only and is secondary to the rider and bike. The following are examples of this style of image:

    <div class="img_row">
	    <img class="col one" src="mbr-08.jpg"/>
	    <img class="col one" src="mbr-15.jpg"/>
	    <img class="col one" src="mbr-23.jpg"/>
    </div>

    </div>

    The first and last images are editorial, from review articles. The middle image is an advert for the bike manufacturer *Specialized*. The editorial images typically have a "natural" colour palette, often with bright, saturated colours, partly as a result of using flash and/or shooting on a sunny day.

    The central image is unusual for using a more muted, de-saturated colour palette. Colour grading and post-processing are more often used in advertising images to create a mood, or allow the image to stand out from the editorial content. In this case the bright yellow helmet of the rider contrasts strongly with the desaturated background and draws the viewer's eye. It helps that the image is dynamic and full of action. The photographer appears to have relied on natural light only in this shot, there is no fill-in flash. This works in the context of the desaturated tones of the image - bright flash would be too much and there is plenty of shadow detail to make out the rider's features.

2. The second type of image could be thought of landscape photography which incorporates mountain biking in the shot. The overall purpose of the image is the same: to demonstrate the thrill of mountain biking, however in this class of image the context and environment in which the sport takes place is brought to the fore.

        <img class="col three" src="dan-barham-03.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <div class="img_row">
        <img class="col three" src="mbr-24.jpg"/>

    <div class="img_row">
        <img class="col three" src="seb-rogers-01.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col three caption">

    </div>

    In this class of image the drama is created by the landscape, the moutain bike riders are simply passing through. The viewer is drawn in by the shared experience (imagined or real) of riding through such dramatic terrain. There is no focus on equipment, gear or even riding style, the experience and drama of the "great outdoors" is everything.

<br/>

These two types of images are not discreet, but rather a continuum. Many images combine aspects of both approaches, for example showing a rider on the broader context of a trail, or a close up of a rider in a larger landscape.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="dan-barham-04.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

</div>

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col three" src="seb-rogers-03.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Source: sebrogers.com
</div>

Then there are advertising images, which are broader in scope and don't always stick to the standard "rider on a trail" trope.

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one" src="mbr-04.jpg"/>
    <img class="col one" src="mbr-18.jpg"/>
    <img class="col one" src="mbr-09.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Source: mbr.co.uk
</div>

The first image is simply a portrait, with lighting and styling to emphasise the dramatic, nature of the sport. It stands out well on the magazine page both because of the image style/genre and because of the high-contrast black & white processing.

The second image is closer to the editorial images in that it includes a rider and bike executing a jump, however it sets the rider in an urban location suggesting a "heist". I don't think that the heist theme is communicated very successfully (unless you read the caption), however more generally the image is slick, well lit and stands out well on the page due to the darker colour palette and atmospheric lighting.

The third image is quite unusual in that it does not include a bike or rider. The idea is simply and the comp well executed and convincing. However I think it fails to have impact mostly because the trail is too ordinary and rather tame looking. It looks to me like Schwable have over-thought the concept ("logs are slippy") and would have been better going for a more dramatic and challenging terrain to get their message across.

<br/>

Finally there is the full-comp approach taken by the likes of Erik Almas. This image fits between the two classes of image described above, the rider and landscape having equal importance. Both aspects of the image are perfectly realised. The colour grading creating warm, natural tones. It is most suitable as an advertising image, with Almas' signature high-end post-production and colour grading. Being a full-comp it would not be suitable for editorial content anyway.

<br/>

For this project I am planning to create 3 images suitable for editorial content, so using a more natural, unprocessed colour palette and style. The aim is to shoot two styles of images:

1. Focus on the rider, bike, equipment and technique. I will use flash to light the rider and bike, ensuring that they stand out against the background trail.

2. Between a "rider" and a "landscape" style shot, creating an image which brings equal balance to the rider and their context. I will be shooting on trails in a forest, so the full blown "landscape" style is not possible, however I would like to introduce elements of the context, flowing lines etc into this style of image. Flash may be used, if necessary, to light the rider. It may be necessary to shoot a backgroud image before shooting the rider so that flash heads & stands can be removed in post-processing. The colour palette of this image may be different to the first style, complementing it or providing an alternative mood.

Both images will be dynamic, including an active rider tackling burns, dropoffs or jumps. I want to capture the drama and action which is commonly seen in the magazine editorial images.

* Location: Beecraigs County Park, West Lothian.
* Riders: skilled mountain bikers with the latest bikes and equipment.
* Equipment: DSLR, lenses, 2-3 speedlights and stands, triggers, grey card.
