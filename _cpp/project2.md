The aim or this project is to create three images of a climber before and during a climb. The first image could include the climber as he prepares for a climb at the base of the crag. The other images should portray the climber as he reaches a critical point in the route. The climber may be slipping (or similar) and his expression could be one of fear, shock, surprise or simple focussed concentration. The same climber will be used in all three shots, however the composition and angle of view will change for each image. For example, one shot could be taken from directly above the climber, another from one side, and another from below with the climber looking down towards the camera.

The images will be comps, incorporating an imaginary landscape, created by bringing together various images during post-production. The climber will be photographed on a small crag or boulder and then placed in the final landscape during post-production.

### Research

The starting point for this project is the following image by David Hill. I have wanted for a while to create a composite image of this kind which combines various elements to create a convincing, but evidently sudo-real, exaggerated, reality. The technique of creating a composite landscape using various elements from different locations is used by many photographers including David Hill, Erik Almas, Bryn Griffiths and others. The concept of using climbing as an element in the image also appeals to me as a climber. However in this case the image is intended not for editorial but for advertising and thus can be more playful and exaggerated.

The David Hill image above is the third in a of three which create a small narrative:

    <img class="col one" src="dave-hill-3.jpg"/>

The narrative aspect is something I want to create in the set of images shot for this project. Three possible "stages" are 1) starting the climb, b) climbing, possibly reaching a "crux" move and c) reaching (or almost reaching!) the top. The brief specifies that the images should be slightly humorous, so exaggeration both in terms of the model's posing and expression and the post-processing are necessary.

The technique of shooting a model or object separately and placing them in a landscape has been used by many photographers. For example the following images by Dean Bradshaw, Chris Close and Erik Almas:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two" src="dean-bradshaw-1.jpg"/>
    <img class="col one" src="chris-close-1.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="caption">

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col three" src="erik-almas-1.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

</div>

In each case the results are convincing, even in the Almas' image where the scene is clearly not of reality. In all three cases the "model" dropped into the scene has been shot with suitable lighting and perspective and has been carefull post-processed and colour graded to acheive a convincing, seamless result.

Another interesting example is this image by David Hill, similar in spirit to his "treasure" images.

As with the "treasure" images, the landscape in the above image appears composed of various different elements to create a dramatic whole. Even the sky may be shot separately when conditions are most suitable and added in post, along with the "sun" which could be entirely artificial, created with a soft brush or similar.

Two things appear important to creating a convincing image:

1. There is a strong narrative element created by the characters within the image - the two humans looking intently out to the left, the vultures circling in the background. This story engages the viewer, she wants to understand the characters within the image, why are they there? what are they doing? etc. This engagement helps to distract the viewer from the plainly fictional background, the viewer is able to "suspend reality".
    
2. Suspension of reality can only take you so far. The other element of these images which allows them to work is that the background has been carefully composed and colour graded so that it appears coherent. It need not appear "natural", but must at least give the appearance of being real.

The same two points are true of the "treasure" images. The protaganist and other elements (map, treasure etc) capture the viewer's interest. The scene is plainly fictitious, constructed - as a photographer we can see that the strong backlight from the setting sun in the first image should cast long shadows from the rock and climber: it does not - however it is coherent and convincing as a whole.

### Implementation

1. I plan to shoot various elements of the background scene in locations such as local crags (e.g. The Hawkcraig at Aberdour), the Scottish Highlands (e.g. Glencoe) and the hills of the English Lake District. A combination of sea, mountain and cliff may be interesting. I intend to shoot on cloudy, overcast days which should make colour grading the combined elements easier.

2. The climber will be shot after the initial background elements have been captured and a rough scene created. Once this is done it should be possible to select a suitable location for the climber. Ideally the crag or boulder used should have rock which roughly matches that of the broader scene. A small crag or boulder will be used so that the model can safely position themselves and where it will be easy to position lighting, cameras etc. A variety of positions, postures and poses will be shot to ensure that there plenty of options available when inserting the model into the final scene. Consideration will be given to the lighting to ensure that it reflects, or at least is sympathetic, to the lighting in the broader scene.

3. It will be important to include as many significant details as possible when shooting/post-processing the scene and model. Such details, for example the dust on the treasure hunter's foot and the coins falling out of her bag in the first "treasure" image, help to create a convincing scene/narrative.

4. Post-processing will necessarily involve blending in and colour grading the various background elements. Once this is done the model will need to be positioned convincingly and colour graded. Effects such as adding blur, haze or etc may be required to blend in some areas.
