Despite ever more sophisticated methods of electronic communication via the internet it is still often the case that technology leaves us isolated from those around us. This project is meant to highlight that loneliness and associated anxiety. The images will be shot on location in situations which are commonly encountered day to day, for example a railway station, office, museum, the home or out on the street.

The intended use for the images is for a UK wide campaign for a well known charity that works with people who have issues of loneliness, inadequacy and mental health.

### Research

A niave approach to this brief might be to photograph a group of people looking at their mobile phones, or a parent ignoring their child, rather like the following two images:

<div class="img_row">

    <img class="col half" src="article-2531233.jpg"/>
</div>

However, both these approaches are rather uninteresting and too obvious. It's something we all experience daily on the train, bus or sitting in a public place, even at home. A literal portrayal of these kind of situations is too familiar and also doesn't communicate strongly enough the concept of lonliness and isolation which the brief calls for.

Originally I had in mind an aesthetic similar to these black & white portraits by Dave Hill. Here the subject is fairly anonymous and the strong back-lighting creates a dark, moody atmosphere. Introducing technology into a scene such as this – for example a mobile phone or tablet - would great a scene which is uneasy with respect to the subject's relationship to the technology.

Another similar aesthetic which caught my eye comes from a scene in Sherlock "The Abominable Bride", recently broadcast by the BBC. In this scene there is also a strong backlight in a darkened room. In this case the "image" is in colour, which creates a warmer mood, but might be interesting to experiement with. A bluer colour grade could remove the warmth and create a more edgy, unsettling scene.

With two, or more figures in the scene there is the potential for creating a feeling of isolation, rather like in the above shot. However, it may be necessary to keep to a single subject to ensure that the relationship with technology comes across strongly enough.

A rather different aesthetic is taken by David Boni in the following image of a lonely, isolated man:

What works well in this image is the use of a desaturated colour palette to communicate a subdued, somber mood; also the body language and facial expression of the man communicates that he is sad or thoughtful. The use of a warm light to highlight the main subject – which also leaves the passers-by in a "desaturated vignette" - ensures the viewer's attention is focussed on the main subject and not on the passers-by. The light also enhances the strange, slightly unsettling mode of the image. Another important aspect is the passers-by themselves, who are all looking at the man, this enhances the unsettling mood further - 'what is going on?' the viewer asks? Finally the location works well, it is a cold, modern space. Perhaps the photographer is trying to communicate the isolation of modern life or modern public spaces?

David Boni's aesthetic works well and seems suitable for communicating the current brief. The unsettling mood, placing the subject in a public space, should work well for establing a sense of lonliness and isolation in relation to technology and other passers-by. Modern interiors such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh Waverly or Haymarket station, could all lend themselves to this approach.

### Implementation

Given logistic problems accessing some of these locations with models and lights, it is intended that the locations will be shot separately from the main subject. Once suitable background images have been captured then the subjects will be shot in the studio, using suitable lighting sympathetic to the location. The more controlled environment of the studio  will also make it easier to create the illusion that the technological device is casting light onto the subject - it could be difficult to acheive this on location. The subject will then be placed into the location image during post-production.
