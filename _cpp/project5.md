We are at the beginning of a revolution in car transportation with the arrival of alternative power sources such as electricity and the hydrogen fuel cell. Companies such as BMW, Tesla, Toyota and Mitsubishi now produce electrically powered vehicles which are accessible to the the higher-end of the market. Most other car manufactures, for example the Volkswagen Group, are developing their own electric or hybrid vehicle solutions. Also, key infrastructure, such as electric charging points, is becoming more widely available, making the widespread adoption of electric vehicles a practical reality.

This project seeks to promote an electric car to early adopters â€“ high value customers who are motivated by design, style and technology and who want to invest in the future. The campaign will feature an electric vehicle in a modern context, featuring architecture or similar infrastructure which reflects and enhances the futuristic design and technology of the vehicle.

### Research

Below is a photo of the Tesla Model S electric car as it currently appears on Tesla's [home page](http://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/) in Feb 2016. It's an exciting, dynamic shot of the Model S, emphasising the performance and style of the car. In this image Tesla are not trying to appeal to the environmentally concious customer, instead they are targetting the "petrolhead", the performance car market. You wouldn't even know from looking at the image that this is an electric vehicle. The different elements of the image - the modern architecture, the open road, the motion blur, the bright light, the desaturated background and the red bodywork - suggest properties such as performance, speed, quality, style and design. In summary this is a very contemporary (but standard) style of promotional image for a high-end car, regardless of the power source.

Other than the lack of motion blur, the Tesla Model S image contains very similar elements to this Lexus IS 200t advert photographed by Greg White. The bright light, the desaturated background, the includsion of "strong", or stylish architecture, the road, and the red car are all present.

Lexus go with a darker look for their NX200h and RX450h hybrid SUVs. Inspite of the darker aesthetic these images incorporate very similar elements to the Model S and IS200t: modern architecture features strongly in the background, emphasising the style and power of the car. The first and third images also incorporate a subtle motion blur, which creates a more dynamic feel. Again the environmental strengths of the hyrbid drive are not referred to by the images - perhaps manufacturers are wary of highlighting their "green" credentials after the recent VW scandal, or perhaps they are simply targetting high-end buyers who care more about design, style and status? The third image - of the RX 450h - does have a predominately blue tone, with a bright blue highlight to the left of the frame: it's possible that consumers could associate this blue tone with electricity.

In the following studio based image BMW play much more strongly on this association, highlighting the electric credentials of their i3 car. Both the blue tone and the electric "lightening" leave the viewer in little doubt that this is an unusual vehicle. Although I think this is an effective image, the previous location based concepts - placing the car in a dramatic urban environment - seem more stylish, reflecting the properties and strengths of the car in its environment.

Following this enviromental approach, Greg White's image of the Lexus LF SA concept car makes full use of a very modern building with clean lines and a bold design. The strong architectural design and geometric forms of the building reflect the very same properties present in the concept vehicle. The smoothly curved edge of the concrete wall and associated shadows behind the car appear to reflect the shape of the car itself.

A similar aesthetic is achieved by Mark Bramley in the following image. He uses an unusual viewpoint, from high above the car. As with Greg White's Lexus LF SA, he uses the form and geometrical design of the building to create a visually interesting image, which reflects (literally) on the car.

Another option is to create a fictional environment, which performs the same functions as the architecture in the earlier images, but which can appear even more dramatic and technologically advanced. A good example are Greg White's images created for the latest Audi TT. In a dramatic costal landscape he places a fictional, raised roadway on which the car drives. The location and exposed road suggest a car which is thrilling to drive, whilst the modern design of the roadway, including the stylish light strip running along each edge, emphasise the advanced technology and design of the vehicle. The motion blur and the swirling mist add to the sense of drama and create a more dynamic image.

The images included above show a variety of vehicles, some using electric or hybrid technologies, some using traditional internal combustion engines. Other than the BMW i3, all the images above use a broadly similar location based approach to communicate the style, design and performance of the vehicle, irrespective of the car's power source. Even Tesla, who are currently at the forefront of electric vehicle design, use imagery with almost identical elements, style and aesthetic to those used for more traditional cars such as the Lexus IS 200t. This isn't surprising given that most of these cars are targetted at high-value customers looking for stylish, well equipped and advanced vehicles whatever the power source.

### Implementation

The first element to consider is the background environment for the image. The most important element will be a building with a modern, striking and clean design. It may be necessary to shoot more than one building and then incorporate the images to form a single, fictional environment during post-processing. Other elements, such as the sky, may also need to be shot separately and then incorporated into the comp to create the desired bright, clean aesthetic.

The above approach assumes that the car will be shot separately (on location or in a studio) and then placed into the environment during post-processing. The alternative would be to find a location which would work as-is and where the car could be placed during the shoot. This approach seems impractical given the very limited budget and time available for this project. Compositing will allow each element of the environment and the car to be shot independently, which should allow for better control of details such as lighting etc.

In the example images shown above it appears that photographers take two approaches to photographing the car: either in-situ, on location, or in the studio. However, it is hard to be certain about this, because images where reflections appear to suggest that the car was photographed in situ could have been faked during post-processing. For example in the image of the Lexus IS 200t the detailed reflections on the car's bodywork and windows suggest that it was shot in-situ. For similar reasons, the same is probably also be true for the Tesla Model S image (top) and below:

<div class="center">
    <img class="col three" src="Tesla-Model-S-top.jpg"/>
</div>

</div>

In most of the other examples (except perhaps the Porsche) the car has almost certainly been shot in the studio and then placed into the environment during post-processing. The highlights, shadows and especially the reflections on the bodywork and windows are very well controlled in all these cases. The cars appear to have been shot under highly controlled conditions, with carefully arranged, diffuse lighting. It's probable in fact that multiple shots have been combined to create the final, perfect car image. As with any comp, care has been taken to ensure that the light intensity, direction and quality etc are suitable for the location in which the object will be placed.

<!-- TODO: Add a little discussion of how we are going to shoot the car. Also the BMW i3 render ;-) -->
