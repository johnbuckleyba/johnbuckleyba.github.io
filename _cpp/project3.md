The aim of this project is to create three studio portraits of workmen (or women) â€“ the focus being on trades which involve manual labour. Each workman will represent a separate trade, for example a plumber, builder, mechanic etc. Each image will be an individual portrait and may be full length or a partial crop, as suits the subject. The images may be post-processed to add drama and to enhance the portrait, this could involve adding in a background image shot on location if necessary.

### Research

The inspiration for this project came from the following image of Paul O'Connell by Alex Telfer. This is a simple, but atmospheric portrait of a rugby player. The image is interesting partly because of its simplicity: it is not over-stylised nor does it use especially strong lighting, however the subject's role is clear from his clothing and physique. The other thing which captures the viewer's attention is the unusual light, diffuse vignette. This creates an atmospheric and slightly mystical mood.

Whilst the above image may not strictly be considered a portrait of a workman or "trade" it lead me to consider such a direction.

Another studio portrait, shot and post-processed with a similar style, is Andy Glass' image of a fighter pilot:

In contrast to the two clean studio portraits above, the style of "advertising" portrait often used to represent the workman is dark, gloomy, sweaty and dirty. For example the following three portraits by Dean Bradshaw:

In the first image the lighting is subdued, the tones are dark and the colour palette used oranges and teals. The lighting is not harsh or hard, but the combination of a key light to the left and a side/rim light to the right creates a strong effect which emphasises the textures and contours of the subject. The greasy, sweaty skin and dirty overalls add to the overall impression of a tough, hard workplace.

The second two images, shot for Wrangler, are similar in style, using strong lighting - with a key light at the front of the subject and a side/rim light on the other side. The colour palette in the left-hand image is cooler, presumably to tone with the light denim shirt which the subject is wearing.

The following image, of a different subject matter, uses simpler lighting - just a single key light - to create a more natural style of portrait. Despite this the rapid fall-off and contrast creates a strong, gritty mood. This is enhanced by the subject's styling and posture, suggestive of boxing.

Another image, also by Alex Telfer, shows a railway worker. In this case the subject appears to have been shot in the studio, again with relatively simple lighting. The worker has been placed on a background in post-production to provide context. The overall mood and style of the image, particularly the subject, is dark and gritty. This is emphasised by the subject's dirty face, coat & hat.

### Implementation

In terms of lighting, post-production and colour palette the following image, by Dean Bradshaw is a useful starting point. Although the subject is not a workman as-such, the lighting, style and mood of the image are suitable strong, dark and gritty.

The following two images of Richard E. Grant are also interesting. Although the lighting is similar the post-production is more restrained, creating a more natural portrait. What I find interesting about these images is the intensity of the tight crop and the strong, off-camera, gaze of the subject; also the post-production - boosting detail and local contrast - enhances the rugged, but restrained, strength of the subject.

This images are cleaner and use a warmer colour palette than intended, but the tight crop and intensity may be worth emulating.
