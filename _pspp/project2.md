### Powerlines

The concept for this project is to create an image which highlights one aspect of power generation or transmission. Possible subjects include pylons, a nuclear power station or wind turbines etc. The style of the image will be clean and desaturated with a strong emphasis on geometry and design. The focus will be on architectural elements of the subject, but may also include the broader landscape.

### Research

The following image by Paul J. Harvey is an example of one possible approach. Here the photographer has concentrated exclusively on the geometry and design of the pylons and powerlines. The pylons, running vertically, and the powerlines, running diagonally across the frame, together create a strong geometric design. The colour palette is desaturated, an almost mono-tonal grey, with a single hint of colour coming from a red warning "bouy". This red object provides balance to the composition, which otherwise might be be weigthed too much to the left by the pylons. Another important aspect of the image is the light, coming from the right, which provides a soft highlight which illuminates the concrete structure of the pylons and provides a focal point for the viewer's eye.

A similar, yet distinctive, approach is taken my Michael Kenna, whose black & white studies of UK power stations dating from the 1980s remain interesting experiments in the use of light, design and texture. In the first two images Kenna cleverly contrasts the hard edges and geometric curves of the concrete cooling towers with the soft, indistinct edges of the clouds of steam rising from the towers. The third image contrasts the regular shape of the triangular supports and the smooth concrete surface of the cooling tower with the irregular, natural textures created by the grass below and sky above.

Although the subject matter is cold and industrial, Kenna manages to create images with a soft, organic feel. The use of black & white removes the distraction of colour and accenuates the distinction between forms and textures within the image.

Also working in black & white, Fay Godwin often used a different approach, contrasting "modern" man-made structures - as in the image below - with the "natural" landscape. Although in this image the scattering of huts, the sheep pen and track are as much a scar on the landscape as the pylons marching through the hills. Despite this there is a juxtaposition between the neat, tidy ordered pylons with the rather random, messy farm buildings.

Similar approach to Fay Godwin...

More topographic approach. Desaturated, but introduces more colour.
