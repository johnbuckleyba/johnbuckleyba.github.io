### Stories of Encounters

Rather than depicting an "encounter" explicity in the frame, I have chosen to create a portrait which hints at some recent, traumatic encounter.

The initial idea came to me whilst researching mountain biking images for my first Commercial Photographic Practise [project](/cpp/project1/). The portrait below, an advert from MBR magazine, contains a great deal of expression. There is a story - of a tough, challenging ride - etched in the subject's face. This lead me to think that a portrait could hint strongly at some recent "story of encounter" and also that a sports related narrative would be suitable for this brief.

### Research

Although the image above sparked the idea for this project it did not represent the mood or style which I wanted to convey in the final image. The MBR advertising portrait has strong lighting, very limited context and appears rather too processed; as a result this creates the impression that the image is contrived, or "set-up".

For the current brief I felt that the most important aspect was to convey a sense of authenticity: the lighting, subject and context should appear as natural and un-mediated as possible. This is important because I want the viewer to identify, or at least empathise strongly, with the subject. The success of the portrait rests on the subject communicating a convincing "narrative of encounter" via their expression and the various other signs within the image.

Examples of this style of natural portrait include Spencer Murphy's images of jockeys shot for Channel 4 Racing:

    <img class="col one" src="Murphy5.jpg"/>
</div>

</div>

Not only does the lighting appear "natural", the context gives the impression that the portraits where shot on location and are authentic rather than "contrived" studio portraits. The signs in the image: the jockey's clothing, the mud-spattered faces, the matted hair, the bruises and the surroundings all convey the impression that these portraits are uncontrived, natural and the subjects unmediated. These signs are important because they add context to the narrative of the portrait. This is something I want to acheive in my own image.

Another of Murphy's portraits is of the footballer Peter Crouch. This image has a darker tone, lacks many of the signs of the Jockey portraits and appears to have been shot in a studio. It's not even obvious (unless you know the subject) that he is a footballer, however the subject's expression is rather thoughtful, pensive and not a little melancholy. This is the key which engages the viewer and allows them to speculate about the subject's story.

The following two portraits by David Boni are also of sports men. However they both appear less natural, certainly than Spencer Murphy's Jockey portraits. The image of Andy Murray has clean studio lighting, a clean white background and the subject himself is neat, tidy and well presented - this is not a portrait with a back story or strong narrative. The second image of a rugby player has signs, such as the bruised face, which hint at a story, however the clean studio lighting, clean background and lack of context all give the impression of a staged, studio image. And unlike the Peter Crouh image there is no thoughtful, melancholy expression to draw in the viewer.

In contrast the following two environmental portaits, also by David Boni, are much more successful at suggesting a context and narrative for the subject. In both images the clothing and immediate environment communicate a great deal about the subject. Combined with a thoughtful gaze - both subjects looking slightly away from the camera - the viewer is drawn into the subject's story and experience.

Finally these two portraits by Alex Telfer use tears to communicate some sort of narrative. The tears, along with their expressions, immediately suggest sadness, perhaps some sort of traumatic emotional enounter or memory. The viewer does not need much more context or information about the subject, the tears themselves are enough to draw in the viewer and encourage speculation about what may have been the cause of this emotion.

### Evaluation

As discussed above my initial idea was to take a sports related portrait with sufficient context and expression to suggest a strong narrative involving an emotional or physical "encounter". The tone and style of the image should be natural and include enough signs and context to provide the viewer with some insight into the subject's experience - a back-story.

As a cyclist myself I choose to photograph a racing cyclist after a long, hard race. As an endurance sport cycling pushes its athletes to extremes of suffering and to their physical limits and like any sport this suffering is both relieved by the joy of winning and exacerbated by the deep disappointment of losing. So the concept was to communicate something of this exhaustion and disappointement in the portrait.

The final image (above) at least succeeds on the following levels:

* The lighting is simple and appears natural.
* The subject's clothing and immediate context (including the outline of a bike in the background) provide sufficient context for the viewer to understand the subject's recent past.
* Other details, such as the mud and sweat, suggest a tough, physically demanding experience.
* Finally the rider's expression is pensive and melancholic. His demeanor, for example the the slightly drooping shoulders, also suggest disappointment and fatigue.

For the above reaons I would conclude that the image does successfully meet the brief as described here. The signs, context and expression of the rider all suggest a narrative, an "encounter" which has led the rider to this place. Hopefull the portrait succeeds in communicating this suggested struggle and enounter to the viewer.

#### Possible Improvements

The main thing which I feel could have improved this image is the inclusion of a tattered race number attached to the front of the rider. This addition was suggested during the shoot, but by then it was too late to obtain a suitable race number. Including this would have made it explicit that the rider had just completed a race.
