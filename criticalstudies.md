### Thoughts

* Is there an updated linguistic analysis of image adverts - to compare with Barthes' analysis?
* Has language become less important in advertising?
* Focus on Brand advertising history / development with case studies e.g. Apple, VW, Silk Cut. McCoys.
* Include mini-histories for each brand.
* Could also include discussion of legal changes e.g. cigarette advertising.
* Deconstruction of design element in contemporary adverts. For example typeface is now inherent in a brand's identity. Does this mean that there are additional categories to consider when analysing an image - no longer limited to linguistic, denotative, connotative messages?
* Introduce the idea that the linguistic message was thought to be a crucial underpinning for semiotic (structural) analysis of the photograph. But perhaps we can move that on to a more broader analysis of the components of the textual sign as understood by a 21st C audience?
* It would also be useful to allude to Plato and/or Barthes.
* Did the change in law affecting cigarette advertising result in a change in technique / presentation? i.e. adverts changed from explicitly enumerating the characteristics of a cigarette to a more opaque "branding" exercise. Adverts began to focus on the brand itself, rather than the product e.g. Silk Cut. Did this re-educate the audience to expect more sophisticated adverts which relied less on the product itself?


### Think ****

Perhaps we could simply compare the "Think Small" and "Think Different" campaigns?
Must have been done before, but still…

### Apple Campaigns

* 1997 - 2002: "Think Different"
Used to re-establish the brand (not product) identity following the crisis years up to 1997.
Very successful, public & media paid attention.

* 2002 - 2003: "Apple Switch"
Used "normal" people to highlight the advantages of the Mac over the PC.
Not so successful.

* 2006 - ??: "Get a Mac"
Smug campaign pointing out how much better Macs are than PCs.
Used a simple, repetitive conversational structure.
Mac are for "fun", PCs are for "work".

### Typography

"Baskerville is different from the rest. I’d call it a 1.5% advantage, in that that’s how much higher agreement is with it relative to the average of the other fonts. That advantage may seem small, but if that was a bump up in sales figures, many online companies would kill for it. The fact that font matters at all is a wonderment." – David Dunning (Morris 2012)

Note we are talking about levels of confidence in a text.

"In fact, my typography mentor used to mention how Baskerville was so good for conveying information because it “disappeared” to the reader more easily than other fonts with more exotic strokes, x-heights, or designs, allowing almost unconscious absorption of the underlying information" (Anderson 2012)

This is interesting - he is suggesting that Baskerville has a naturalising effect, like the photographic image it appears to 'get out of the way'. Really good point ;-)

Form (typeface etc) does not change the literal (denoted?) signified, but does change the connoted meaning!

This follows because we can make the assumption that typeface is paradigmatic I.e. a change in typeface changes the way we interpret a brand or headline (proof?). Thus it must be a signifier, independent of the literal, denoted (?) meaning of the text (note: we must be careful by what we mean by denoted!).

    "His solution: Leave out anything that smacked of advertising. As early as 1963, he famously left the Avis logo off his Avis ads. A logo, or any other convention of advertising, simply warned the skeptical reader, "I'm an ad, ignore me." Or worse, "Don't trust me."" (Cooke, 1999)

    "Smart admakers… finally learned that if you trusted the reader to draw his own conclusions, he'd respect you. And possibly even trust you." (Cooke, 1999)

### Semiotics

Notes from Chandler, 2007.

#### Saussure 19th Century
Strongly tied to the European tradition of structuralism (and later post-structuralism).
Has no well identified methodologies or subjects, though is often applied to linguistics and cultural studies. 

"The major constraint affecting any social practise is that it signifies; I.e. that it is articulated like a language." (Kristeva, 1973)

Language (linguistics) is very important to semiotics:

"Language is the interpreting system of all other systems, linguistic and non-linguistic." (Benveniste, 1979)

* Signifier (sign) - Saussure identifies this primarily as spoken language (sound).
* Signified (concept) - Saussure restricts the signified to concepts (thoughts) only, not to real, material objects.

Also note: "the signifier or representamen  [Pierce] is the form in which the sign appears (such as the spoken or written form of a word) whereas the sign is the whole meaningful ensemble." (Chandler, 2002)

There is a dynamic between the signifier and the signified: one has no meaning without the other.

Additionally signifiers have no value (meaning) as individual units. They only take on meaning in relationship to other signifiers. In language with associate a stream of signifiers (syntagem) with a thought, concept, action etc which creates meaning. It is a dynamic association.

A signifier is part of a system and only has value (meaning) as a part of the system.
Meaning and value (of a signifier) are not necessary equivalent. For example mouton in French refers to both the animal and the meat; in English mutton refers to the latter only.

#### Differentiation between signifiers is fundamental:

"Saussure's relational conception of meaning was specifically differential: he emphasized the differences between signs. Language for him was a system of functional differences and oppositions. 'In a language, as in every other semiological system, what distinguishes a sign is what constitutes it' (Saussure 1983, 119; Saussure 1974, 121). As John Sturrock points out, 'a one-term language is an impossibility because its single term could be applied to everything and differentiate nothing; it requires at least one other term to give it definition' (Sturrock 1979, 10). Advertising furnishes a good example of this notion, since what matters in 'positioning' a product is not the relationship of advertising signifiers to real-world referents, but the differentiation of each sign from the others to which it is related. Saussure's concept of the relational identity of signs is at the heart of structuralist theory. Structuralist analysis focuses on the structural relations which are functional in the signifying system at a particular moment in history. 'Relations are important for what they can explain: meaningful contrasts and permitted or forbidden combinations'  (Culler 1975, 14) "  (Chandler, 2002)

"What characterizes each most [signifier] most exactly is being what the others are not." (Saussure, 1983)

There is an arbitrariness about the link between the linguistic sign (sound) and its signified. The sound (or word) "tree" is not treeish. This provides language its great flexibility.
Perhaps this is not so true about photography and/or graphics design in general?

"Linguistic categories are not simply a consequence of some predefined structure in the world. There are no 'natural' concepts or categories which are simply 'reflected' in language. Language plays a crucial role in 'constructing reality'." (Chandler, 2002)

Language does not reflect reality, rather it constructs it! 

Lacan emphasised the signifer over the signifed. The signfied "slips under" the siginifier, being fixed by it.

Language is ontologically arbitrary - but once signifers are established they become fixed by tradition, culture, usage etc.

"Saussure felt that the main concern of semiotics should be 'the whole group of systems grounded in the arbitrariness of the sign'." (Chandler, 2002)

The ultimate arbitrariness of signifers in the Saussurean system means that even if signs appear neutral and are accepted as natural  their meaning must still be questioned.

Semioticians should avoid "the familiar mistake of assuming that signs which appear natural to those who use them have an intrinsic meaning and require no explanation" (Culler 1975, 5).

#### Relativity

Post-Saussure semioticians  think of the relation between signifiers and "real" objects as more complex than the conceptual bracketing of the referent suggested by Saussure. i.e. there may be some slipage of the signfied 'concept' to the 'object'.

There are 'conventional signs' (signa data, i.e. arbitrary signs, adopted by convention) and 'natural signs' (signa naturalia, i.e. a footprint, smoke indicating fire, a tomato in a photograph etc).

Pierce offered a more complex triadic model (compared with Saussure's dyadic model). However it is useful to think of a typology of signs:

1. Symbol/symbolic: there is no resemblance between the sign and the signified. The signifier is therefore arbitrary and is deteremined by convention.
2. Iconic: the sign resembles (visually, aurally etc) the signified. Often the resemblance is cultural, rather than being a 'true' resemblance, e.g. the computer icon, a diagram, etc. However in semiotics for a signifier to be an icon it must resemble (sub-conciously?) the signifier, otherwise it must be learned and is therefor simply a symbolic signifier.
3. Indexical: the signifier is directly connected (physically or causally) to the signified. The signifier points directly to the signified.

"The more a signifier is constrained by the signified, the more 'motivated' the sign is: iconic signs are highly motivated; symbolic signs are unmotivated. The less motivated the sign, the more learning of an agreed convention is required." (Chandler, 2002)

Be careful with the terms symbol, icon - these have different meanings within semiotics than they do in normal, casual use (Chandler 2002, 38,40)

Photographs can be thought of as both iconic and indexical. 
"A photograph… owing to its optical connection with its object, is evidence that that appearance corresponds to a reality." (Pierce, 1931-1958)

However John Tagg is wary of this 'realist position':
"the existence of a photograph is no guarentee of a corresponding pre-photographic existent… the indexical nature of the photograph - the causative link between the pre-photographic referent and the sign… can guarentee nothing at the level of meaning." (Tagg 1988)
Tagg also argues that every photograph involves 'significant distortions' (ibid.).

#### Types and Tokens

Material signifiers are considered tokens, and are instances of a single signifier type. 

Eco suggested three category of sign vehicles (Eco 1976):

* Signs in which there may be any number of tokens (copies). E.g. printed word, photograph.
* Signs whose tokens posses a quality of material uniqueness. E.g. written word, word printed with a specific typeface.
* Signs whose token is their type. I.e. a unique object such as an oil painting.

Note that in the modern age most tokens are actually copies, even if they refer to a unique original, c.f. Benjamin's Work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction. The experience of the token as copy may influence the viewer even if they eventually experience the original, unique token.

The type-token distinction is not a property of the original sign vehicle, but only matters when considering material implementations of the sign, insofar as it influences the interpretation of the signifier.

#### Rematerializing the Sign

Sassure did not consider that the material composition of the signifier was significant - the signifier could be considered as purely conceptual. Referring to written signs he states:

"the actual mode of inscription is irrelevant, because it does not affect the system... Whether I write in black or white, in incised characters or in relief, with a pen or a chisel - none of that is of any importance for the meaning" (Sassure, 1983)

"The linguist... is interested in types, not tokens" (Lyons, 1977)

Pierce also did not consider that the material quality of the sign changed its representative function:

"since a sign is not identical with the thing signified, but differs from the latter in some respects, it must plainly have some characters which belong to it in itself... These I call the material qualities of the sign" (Pierce, 1931-58)

Later semioticians do take into account the material qualities of the signifier:

"Semioticians must take seriously any factors to which sign-users ascribe significance, and the material form of a sign does sometimes make a difference. Contemporary theorists tend to acknowledge that the material form of the sign may generate connotations of its own" (Chandler, 2002).

"For Voloshinov, writing in 1929, all signs, including language, have 'concrete material reality' (Voloshinov, 1973) and the physical properties of the sign matter." (Chandler, 2002).

Voloshinov's position became more widely accepted in the 1970s. More recent studies have shown that material objects can themselves function as signifiers with associated signifieds creating a sense of personal and social identity e.g. a car, house, watch etc which is associated with a certain status; brands too presumably?

Brand semiotics e.g. [http://www.brandingmagazine.com/2015/02/04/the-semiotics-of-brand-building/]()

"People attach 'symbolic values' to television sets, furniture and photograph albums which are not determined by the utilitarian functions of such mundane objects." (Chandler 2002).

Lévi-Straus s had already emphasised that 'identify can be expressed through the manipulation of existing things' (Lévi-Strauss, 1962)

Jay David Boulter argues that signs 'signs are always anchored in a medium. Signs may be more or less dependent upon the characteristics of one medium - they may transfer more or less well to other media - but there is no such thing as a sign without a medium' (Boulter, 1991)

"The sign as such may not be a material entity, but it has a material dimension – the signifier (or sign vehicle). Hodge and Tripp note, 'fundamental to all semiotic analysis is the fact that any system of signs (semiotic code) is carried by a material medium which has its own principles of structure' (Hodge and Tripp, 1986)." (Chandler 2002)

"The medium is not neutral; each medium has its own affordances and constraints and, as Umberto Eco notes, each is already 'charged with cultural signification' (Eco 1976)… Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen argue that 'the material expression of the text is always significant; it is a separately variable semiotic feature' (Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996). Changing the signifier at the level of the form or medium may thus influence the signified - the sense which readers make of what is ostensibly the same 'content'. '' (Chandler 2002).

#### Hjelmselv's Framework

The sign system can be thought of as the form (signifier) and content (signified). However this is reductive because both the signifier and the signified may have form and content. Hjelmslev suggested a framework where both the signifier and signified may be considered to have substance and form.

"Such a matrix provides a useful framework for the systematic analysis of texts, broadens the notion of what constitutes a sign, and reminds us that the materiality of the sign may in itself signify." (Chandler, 2002)

#### Signs and Things

This chapter discusses the property of language to construct reality rather than simply reflecting it. For example there are generally not universal concepts or even nouns which are easily translatable between languages, suggesting that a culture constructs their own view of reality via language. (Chandler 2002).

Watch out for realism (signifiers refer to material signfieds) but also idealism (e.g. Saussure) who assert that signifiers cannot ever refer to material signifieds.

"People can identify an image as a hand when it is drawn as a cartoon more quickly than when they are shown a photograph of a hand (Ryan and Schwartz 1956). This underlines the importance of perceptual codes when constructing reality. Umberto Eco argues that through familiarity an iconic signifier can acquire primacy over its signified. Such a sign becomes conventional 'step by step, the more its addressee becomes acquainted with it. At a certain point the iconic representation, however stylized it may be, appears to be more true than the real experience, and people begin to look at things through the glasses of iconic convention' (Eco 1976)." (Chandler 2002)

Goes on to discuss modality (modes of reality) or the truthfulness (or representativeness) or a signifier. For example film and photography are assumed to be one of the most "truthful" mediums, however we should never forget that photography does not reproduce the object, it 'abstracts form, and mediates, the actual' (Burgin, 1982b).

A photograph (or film) may be considered truthful at the connotative level, even if it is obviously not so at the denotative level (Ang, 1985) Internal consistency may become significant w.r.t. truth for consumers of these mediums (Chandler 2002).

"Different genres, whether classified by medium or by content establish sets of modality markers, and an overall value which acts as a baseline for the genre." (Hodge and Kress, 1988)

This relies on an aesthetic code. Overtime certain modes of production, styles or conventions become accepted or naturalised. The content is then accepted as a reflection of reality (Chandler 2002).

Magritte's 'The Treachery of Images'. Could be taken to mean many things, but perhaps the most obvious is that this image of a pipe is not a pipe! It is also interesting that the textual element acts as anchorage to the painting of a pipe.

#### Empty Signifiers

Postmodernists argued that signifers could not be considered to have a direct relationship to a specific signified and could, in fact, relate to any arbitrary signified. This is in contrast to structuralists (i.e. Sassure) who argued there was a direct 1to1 relationship between signifier and signified. Lacann wrote of the 'incessant sliding of the signified under the signifier' (Lacann, 1977). Derrida referred to freeplay the 'infinite referral of signifier to signified' (Derrida, 1967b).

"Signs thus always refer to other signs, and there is no final sign referring to itself." (Chandler, 2002)

There is no 'transcendent signified' only 'endless deferral' (Derrida, 1967b)

#### Analysing Structures

"Structural analysis focus on the structural relations which are functional in the signifying system at a particular moment in history" 

"Identifies the constituent units, and structural relationships between them (oppositions, correlations and logical relationships)."
(Chandler, 2002).

Saussure: meaning arises from differences between signifiers. There are two kinds: syntagmatic (concerning positioning) and paradigmatic (concerning substitution). Seen as applicable to all sign systems.

"The aphorism of Marshal McLuhan (1911-80) that 'the medium is the message' can thus be seen as reflecting a semiotic concern: to a semiotician the medium is not neutral." (Chandler, 2002)

The 'Commutation Test' can be useful to identify why one signifier is used rather than another (paradigmatic) or why they were used in a certain order (syntagmatic). For example how does switching the caption of a photograph change its meaning?

#### Structural analysis:

* Paradigmatic dimension: the possible space of meanings contained in the category of the signifier (or signified).
* Oppositions: binary oppositions are essential to the generation of meaning e.g. 'light' vs 'dark'.
* Markedness: an operation or weighting which flips the meaning of a signifier (or signified) e.g. 'happy' (unmarked) -> 'unhappy' (marked)
* Alignment: useful to analyse a system by considering which may be the 'marked' and 'unmarked' classes or styles. For example in toy advertising it appears that boy's adverts are production and editing styles are closer to generic adverts, with girl's adverts standing in opposition. Thus the girl's adverts are 'marked', with boy's/generic adverts being 'unmarked' in this context (Chandler, 2002) (Chandler and Griffiths 2000). The production features used to generate this adverts used a series of binary oppositions. Oppositions (e.g. myth : fact, nature : culture, male : female etc help the theorist to define and explain movements or styles. Developing one set of binary opposition (or analogical relationships) leads to further oppositions, one held the other not held (the opposite!).Persil advert: 'dirt is good'. Reverses the traditional alignment of cleanliness, godliness and science. Now dirt is associated with goodness (or at least fun) and nature is shown in a positive light. Changes one myth into another.
* Syntagmatic dimension: "Structuralists study texts as syntagmatic structures. The syntagmatic analysis of a text… involves studying its structure and relationships between its parts. Structural semioticians seek to identify elementary constituent segments within the text – its syntagems." (Chandler 2002)Saussure emphasised the temporal relationship between signifiers, but in visual communication the spatial relationships are also important.
* Spatial relations: obviously very important for analysing photographs for which there is no temporal dimension (at least at the level of the signifiers). These spatial relationships (above/below, left/right etc) are not semantically neutral.Three key spatial directions: left/right e.g. left may be associated with 'now', right with 'future'; up/down e.g.  Up with 'more', 'male', 'mythical', down with 'less', 'female', 'worldly' etc; centre/margin e.g. centre displays the key element, margins contain anciliary information. 
* Sequential relations: really just boils down to a narrative. Narrative is considered central to the way humans make sense of the world. A narrative creates 'events' and turns a story into a plot with a beginning, middle and end (resolution/closure).

#### Challenging the Literal

Denotation and connotation refer to the signified. Denotation refers to the 'literal' meaning – however there are problems with this, what is a literal meaning, would it be universal for all cultures and times; if not then it slips into the connotation, subjective, meaning which is subjective. 

"Signs are more polysemic – more open to interpretation – in their connotations than their denotations." (Chandler, 2002)

Barthes argued that Saussure relied too much on the denotative meaning, ignoring the connotative. He argued that the connotative meaning was fundamental to interpreting photographs ('The Photographic Message', Barthes 1961 and 'The Rhetoric of the Image' Barthes 1964).

'Denotation is what is photographed, connotation is how it is photographed' (Fisk, 1982)

Denotation can be considered to be working at a 'natural' level, such that it is transparent to the reader. However Barthes points out that no signifier is really natural, but rather naturalised. In this sense denotation is really naturalised connotation. (Barthes 1974, Voloshinov 1973).

"There can be no neutral, literal description which is free of an evaluative element." (Chandler, 2002)

Denotation this involves structural or social agreement. However connotation is not entirely subjective either, it also involves socially or culturally agreed readings. Only so many connotations will make sense to a culture for a given signifier - they require culturally agreed codes for interpretation.

"Cultural codes provide a connotational framework since they are 'organised around key oppositions and equations', each term being 'aligned with a cluster symbolic attributes' (Silverman 1983)." (Chandler 2002).

Barthes considered there were orders of signification.

Denotative (signifier & signified) -> combine to create a separate signifier with a connotative signified(s).

"Subtle changes of style or tone may involve different connotations, such as changing from sharp focus to soft focus when taking a photograph or using different typefaces for exactly the same text. Indeed, the generation of connotations from typography alone demonstrates how important the material aspect of written language can be as a signifier in its own right. One study, for instance, has shown how various typefaces were rated by some computer users in the USA in terms of how 'youthful and fun' or how 'business-like' each was perceived as being (Bernard et al. 2001)." (Chandler 2002)

[http://usabilitynews.org/determining-the-best-online-font-for-older-adults/]()

#### Myth

Can be considered a 'higher order' connotation. Myths are ideological narratives which are central to our understanding and interpretation of the world. For example the myth of objectivism in the Western world. Also masculinity, feminism, Englishness, freedom, individualism, success etc.

Note: I expect that many adverts build or key into such myths, suggesting connotations which signify such narrative explanations.

Barthes was particularly interested in exploring these myths. For instance Mythologies (1957), Paris Match (1957) and The Rhetoric of the Image (1977).

The function of myths is to provide 'ideological naturalisation' (Chandler 2002). 

"Their function is to naturalize the cultural - in other words, to make dominant cultural and historical values, attitudes and beliefs seem entirely 'natural', 'normal', self-evident, timeless, obvious 'common-sense' - and thus objective and 'true' reflections of 'the way things are'." (Chandler 2002).

"…those who do try to analyse their own cultures in this way must also seek to be explicitly reflexive about their 'own' values." (Chandler 2002)

#### Codes

"the production and interpretation of texts depends upon the existence of codes or conventions for communication (Jakobson, 1960, 1971)." (Chandler 2002).

"The convention of codes present a social dimension in semiotics: a code is a set of practises familiar to users of the medium operating within a broad cultural framework. Indeed, as Stuart Hall puts it, 'there is no intelligible discourse without the operation of a code' (Hall, 1973)." (Chandler 2002).

Types of Code:
* Social codes: e.g. verbal, bodily, commodity (posessions etc).
* Textual codes: e.g. scientific, mathematic, aesthetic, genre, mass media (inc. photography).
* Interpretive codes: e.g. visual perception, ideological codes (e.g. feminism, liberalism, individualism etc).

##### Perceptual Codes

"Confronted by a visual image, we seem to need to separate a dominant shape (a 'figure' with a definite contour) from what our current concerns relegate to 'background' (or 'ground')." (Chandler, 2002). See also Gestalt philosophers.

##### Social Codes

For example 'pink or blue' for girls and boys. Determined by tradition.

##### Textual Codes

"Codes help to simplify phenomena in order to make it easier to communicate experiences. In reading texts, we interpret signs with reference to what seem to be appropriate codes. This helps to limit their possible meanings." (Chandler, 2002)

##### Codes of Realism

Even visual codes are learnt and consist of signifiers which have a socially constructed meaning. This even applies to photography:

"…we have to decode the cues.  Semioticians argue that, although exposure over time leads 'visual language' to seem natural, we need to learn how to 'read' even visual and audio-visual texts." (Chandler, 2002).

Pierce referred to photographs as indexical as well as iconic. However Berger and Barthes both referred to photographs as having no 'language of its own' (Berger, 1968) and 'the photographic image… is a message without a code' (Barthes, 1961).

Barthes is referring to the continuous nature of the image i.e. it cannot be split up into individual elements (?). It is an analogue (not digital) system. Can we 'conceive of an analogical code' (Barthes 1964) - no!

"The relation between the signifier and the thing signified is not arbitrary as in language (Barthes, 1964)." (Chandler, 2002).

Barthes grants that photography involves transformation (e.g. 3-D to 2-D, cropping, framing, composition, angle, lighting, focus etc), however he believes that photography  does not 'involve rule-governed transformation as codes can (Barthes 1961, 1964)." (Chandler, 2002).

"In the photography  – at least at the level of the literal message – the relationship of signifieds to signifiers is not one of transformation but of recording." (Barthes, 1964).

"There is no necessity to set up… a code, between the object and the image." (Barthes 1961).

However he identifies, above the literal denotative level, a higher level where a connotative code can be identified.

"At the 'level of reception', the photograph 'is not only perceived, received, it is read, connected by the public that consumes it to a traditional  stock of signs' (Barthes, 1961). Reading a photograph involved relating it to a 'rhetoric' (ibid)." (Chandler, 2002).

"Thanks to the code of connotation the reading of the photograph is… always historical; it depends on the reader's 'knowledge' just as though it were a matter of a real language, intelligible only if one has learned the signs." (Barthes, 1961)

So there are 'codes' involved in receiving or interpreting a photograph at the connotative level (e.g. posture, lighting, etc, etc). However Barthes is saying that at the raw denotative level of the photograph there is only replication: we cannot 'reduce the photographic image itself to elementary "signifying units"' (Chandler, 2002). 

Barthes adds that 'the viewer receives at one and the same time the perceptual message and the cultural message' (Barthes, 1964).

Watch out for the naturalising effect of the denotative 'literal' message in photography, which can obscure an ideological function: 'photography seems to found in nature the signs of culture… masking the constructed meaning under the appearance of the given meaning' (Barthes, 1964).

However Chandler points out that most semioticians 'emphasize that photography involves visual codes, and that film and television involve both visual and aural codes' (Chandler, 2002). 'the camera is never neutral (Tagg, 1988).

"While some photographic and filmic codes are relatively arbitrary, many of the codes employed in realistic photographic images or filesm simulate many of the perceptual cues used in encountering the physical world (Nichols, 1981)." (Chandler, 2002).

##### Broadcast and Narrowcast Codes

May have some relevance to understanding advertising images?

Broadcast codes: simpler, wide appeal, easy to learn, contain redundancy i.e. several elements serve to emphasize and reinforce preferred meanings. Eco describes texts which use broadcast codes as 'closed' - encouraging a particular interpretation (Eco, 1981).

Narrowcast codes: more complex, less accessible, require learning. Has a minimum of redundancy. 
 
##### Codification

Codes are not static, they develop dynamically over time.

In marketing three types of codes are dominant codes (prevailing codes used currently), residual codes (codes in decline) and emergent codes (Alexander, 2000).
