### Powerlines

The concept for this project is to create an image which highlights one aspect of power generation or transmission. Possible subjects include pylons, a nuclear power station or wind turbines etc. The style of the image will be clean and desaturated with a strong emphasis on geometry and design. The focus will be on architectural elements of the subject, but may also include the broader landscape.

### Research

The following image by Paul J. Harvey is an example of one possible approach. Here the photographer has concentrated exclusively on the geometry and design of the pylons and powerlines. The pylons, running vertically, and the powerlines, running diagonally across the frame, together create a strong geometric design. The colour palette is desaturated, an almost mono-tonal grey, with a single hint of colour coming from a red warning "buoy". This red object provides balance to the composition, which otherwise might be be weigthed too much to the left by the pylons. Another important aspect of the image is the light, coming from the right, which provides a soft highlight which illuminates the concrete structure of the pylons and provides a focal point for the viewer's eye.

A similar, yet distinctive, approach is taken my Michael Kenna, whose black & white studies of UK power stations dating from the 1980s remain interesting experiments in the use of light, design and texture. In the first two images Kenna cleverly contrasts the hard edges and geometric curves of the concrete cooling towers with the soft, indistinct edges of the clouds of steam rising from the towers. The third image contrasts the regular shape of the triangular supports with the smooth, curved concrete surface of the cooling tower and with the irregular, natural textures created by the grass below and sky above.

Although the subject matter is cold and industrial, Kenna manages to create images with a soft, organic feel. The use of black & white removes the distraction of colour and emphasises the distinction between forms and textures within the image.

Also working in black & white, Fay Godwin often used a different approach, contrasting "modern" man-made structures - as in the image below - with the "natural" landscape. Although in this image the scattering of huts, the sheep pen and track are as much a scar on the landscape as the pylons marching through the hills. Despite this there is a juxtaposition between the neat, tidy ordered pylons with the rather random, messy farm buildings.

Godwin was interested in the impact humans have on the landscape, how they shape and form it. Her images of of "wild" places nearly always incorporated human-made structures, or the evidence of human activity on the landscape. This can be seen for example in her unusual image of Meall Mor taken from the middle of the A82 road, emphasising the proximity and presence of this large human-made structure in the middle of Glencoe. Most images of mountains, particularly those of Glencoe, are romanticised: the photographer will step off the road to give the impression of wilderness - but not Godwin, who places the road front and centre. More subtle is Godwin's image of moorland at Glen Tanar. Even in this image there is evidence of human tracks and managed heather burning which creates and maintains this "natural" landscape.

John Davies is another photographer with an interest in humandkind's impact on the landscape. Like Godwin he is concerned not only in the structures themselves, but also their context. Davies often shoots from a high vantage point, looking downwards to his subject - this avoids giving the structures a sense of power: they do not impose visually on the viewer; but rather impose themselves on the surrounding landscape. His images are not abstract studies of form and structure, like those of Harvey or Kenna, but honest, often brutal, depictions of the landscape as it really is. Davies' (and Godwin's) use of black and white adds to the sense of bleakness, especially in images such as the one of Agecroft Power Station shown below.

Edgar Martins uses a more modern, desaturated style for his photographs; the subjects of which range from Britsh housing, the European Space Agency to a study of Hydro-electric plants. Two images from the later project are shown below. Martins tends to use a neutral "topographic" point of view for many of his images. They do not include a great deal of context, but tend to focus on the subject itself. Many of the images from the Hydro-electric project are interior shots of the plants, the generating halls and control rooms etc. Martins is skilled in his use of composition, form and colour to create interesting and mysterious images of subjects which might be considered rather sterile.

In the current project I would like to take a similar viewpoint to that of Godwin and Davies: considering human structures in the context of the landscape; but using an aestheic closer to that of Martins: desaturated, with a myterious, other-worldly mood.

The work is aimed at the 'Places' category of the AOP 2016 awards. The images will capture the environment and the way in which humans have altered and shaped it.

### Evaluation

Highlights from the project are shown below. The images include pylons from the Beauly-Denny powerline on the south and north bank of the Forth Estuary. They were shot from the south bank. Some images also include the Clackmannashire road bridge from the same location. I choose weather conditions which were clear and frosty and was fortunate that, during the early part of the shoot, a mist formed on the Forth adding to a sense of mystery and also obscuring the blue sky.

The images meet my most basic aim of capturing human structures within the context of the landscape. In the first four images shown below the focus is broader than simply the form and geometry of the sturctures themselves. The structures - pylons, fences, bridges - are used to construct the composition. The mist helps to create a sense of mystery in the first three images where the pylons and north shore are partially hidden by the enveloping mist. This prevents the eye from "joining up" the forms and making complete sense of the composition, which adds interest. The mist is missing from the fourth image, creating a more static, less interesting composition.

The final two images were an attempt at a more detailed study of the structure and geometry of the pylons themselves, although still including some context. They communicate the strength and power of these structures, which loom like giants over the flat fields.

Overall I believe that the images are successfull in meeting the original brief - displaying these structures within the landscape using a modern, desaturated aethetic.

The most successful image may be the first one below: the combination of the fence, bridge, river and pylon create a satisfying composition. The mist, which prevents the eye from completely resolving the composition, creates an added level of ambiguity. The pylon rises myteriously out of the mist and draws the eye, above all the other elements in the picture.

#### Possible Improvements

In future I would like to explore the geometric forms of pylons and power generation with a visual approach which focuses on the form, rather than context. The images from the current project which did focus on the pylons were not as successful as those that included the wider landscape.
