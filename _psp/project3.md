### The Quest

This project is concerned with the quest to build a robot which can sense, respond to and mimic human interactions and cognitive abilities. There are many elements to this endeavour: developments are required both in terms of hardware - for example touch sensitive "skin" - and, perhaps most crucially, to Computer Science, more commonly known in this context as *artificial intelligence*. The development of computer algorithms which can enable the robot to perform complex tasks such as object and language cognition and - perhaps more importantly for natural, human interactions - contextualisation ("that" cup) are still topics for research. One platform which is enabling research into these, and other, areas of robotics is the [iCub](http://www.icub.org/) robot.

### Research

The iCub was originally developed in 2004 by the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.it/), designed as a platform to enable research into artificial cognition and learning. The iCub's design was strongly influenced by the theory of [*Embodied Cognition*](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/a-brief-guide-to-embodied-cognition-why-you-are-not-your-brain/). This is a cognitive theory which suggests that the way humans learn and understand the world - the way our minds develop - is strongly influenced by our physical connections to the world: our senses and our motor systems. Thus the iCub was designed as a humanoid robot the size of a small child, with the intention that its own interactions will follow similar patterns to our own.

Embodied Cognition theory goes further, arguing that our entire system of thought and language is formed, constrained and interpreted in the context of our interactions with the physical world. A trivial example is the metaphor "this is over my head" - used when we don't understand a concept or idea - which is a direct product of our physical experience of the world. Thus if we want robots to understand and reason about the world as we do, then, according to Embodied Cognition, they should also sense and interact in similar ways to humans.

Physically the iCub has a number of advanced capabilities, including:

* Stereo vision.
* Hearing.
* Speech, including a motorised mouth to mimic the mechanics of human speech.
* Jointed arms, legs and hands.
* The hands include touch sensors and can pick up objects.
* Facial expressions via the eyes, mouth and LED lights.
* Walking.
* Collision avoidance.

The iCub is currently used by a number of projects and research groups. One such group is [Edinburgh Robotics](http://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/), a collaboration between The University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University.

Robots, and more broadly science fiction, has long been an interesting subject for artists. From Mary Shelly's *Frankenstein* to films such as *Terminator*, *Blade Runner* and the more recent *Ex Machina*, we love to explore the implications and repercussions, often portrayed negatively, of autonomous, intelligent machines.

Photographically an important contribution was made in the 2001 book [*Robo Sapiens*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0262632454/sr=1-1/qid=1457888263/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1457888263&sr=1-1), a collaboration between writer Faith D'Alusio and photographer Peter Menzel. In *Robo Sapiens* the authors attempt to summarise and record the state of robotic research at the turn of the millenium. The book also explores the future, when robots can walk, talk, think and interact like us and with us.

Stylistically the photographs from *Robo Sapiens* appear dated, perhaps partly due to the fact that they were created before the digital era. They are generally low-key, dark and moody, creating an atmosphere not too different from that of the film *Blade Runner*.

My own preference for representing technology is for images which are brighter, cleaner and less mysterious. The public perception and aesthetics associated with technology has changed a great deal since even 2001 when *Robo Sapiens* was published. Perhaps there is no better example of this change in attitude and aesthetic than the rise of mobile technology, particularly the iPhone which is generally portrayed by Apple using bright, colourful, clean imagery:

The photographer Greg White often chooses technology as his subject. A good example are the following images from his "Made in Britain" series. White uses a clean, desaturated colour palette for these images. His image of a server room at CERN uses a very similar aesthetic.

### Evaluation

The iCub owned by Edinburgh Robotics consists of the head only. This is because the group's primary research interest is natural language and cognition, capabilities which do not require the rest of the iCub's body. From a visual point of view this is unfortunate because it would have been interesting to capture the entire robot; a full body would have permitted more options and expression via posture.

In the image I wanted to portray the iCub's "humanity", or at least the human-like expressiveness of its face, but to also emphasise the technology. I also wanted to suggest the idea of *The Quest*: the strive to create an artificial intelligence which can sense, interact and communicate in a human-like manner.

I think that the final image succeeds in meeting the above criteria: the iCub's face is expressive, looking upwards and out of the frame to something beyond, it communicates the idea of searching, of a *quest*. Even the slightly open mouth, formed by the iCub's mask - which is used to hide the mechanism which controls the robot's mouth - suggests surprise, or perhaps wonder.

The technological component is also present, represented by the circuitry and mechanisms in the iCub's neck. 

Completing the composition is the iCub's "umbilical cord", a cable providing power and connecting the robot to its artificial mind, hosted by an external computer. The cable balances the composition and suggests that the iCub is not isolated: it is connected to the world outside of the frame.

#### Possible Improvements

One interesting improvement to this image would have been the inclusion of some direct interaction with the physical world: after all the iCub is designed to physically interact and learn from its environment. However in this case because the robot has no body its interaction is limited to the senses of sight, sound and speech, making the interaction visually less compelling.

Another possibility would have been the inclusion of a human being in the image, possibly interacting with the iCub. This would add an interesting dimension to the image, however I think it would have been difficult to achieve a clean and minimalist composition with the addition of a human subject.
