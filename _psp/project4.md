### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to produce a single image for submission to the BIPP Scotland Student Awards 2016 in the Advertising and Fashion category.

### Research

The British Institute of Professional Photography is a qualifying organisation which provides support, advice and networking for professional photographers. The organisation's membership includes photographers working across many genres from wedding and social to commercial photography. As such the aesthetic and style of images produced by its members is broad and varied.

This breadth of membership and genres stands in contrast to the Association of Photographers. Although in many ways a similar organisation, the AOP tends to draw its members from the more commercial end of the industry, including photographers who are working in areas such as advertising and who have entered the industry via the more traditional route of assisting. Indeed most members of the AOP must first become "assistant" members before progressing to full membership.

The BIPP also has progressive membership levels, starting with a Licentiateship, then Associateship and, for exceptional work, there is a Fellowship. However, the qualifications for entry are based primarily on the quality of the applicant's portfolio, whatever their chosen genre or clients. There is no requirement, as with the AOP, to choose a more commercial approach starting with an apprenticeship membership.

This difference in approach and membership does influence the work produced by members of both organisations, creating subtle differences - although there is obviously some overlap. This is especially apparent in the annual awards run by each organisation.

Even the award categories reflect the difference in emphasis found in the two organisations. For example in 2015 the professional (non-student) categories were:

#### BIPP Scotland
* Industrial, Commercial, Advertising & Architecture
* Pictorial & Illustrative
* Open
* Wedding
* Press & PR
* Portraiture
    
#### The AOP (UK)
* Commissioned Advertising
* Commissioned Design
* Commissioned Editorial
* Non-Commissioned Portrait
* Non-Commissioned Life
* Non-Commissioned Environment
* Non-Commissioned Objects
* Non-Commissioned Fashion & Beauty

These categories illustrate the AOP's focus on commissioned, commercial photography, as well as more "open" non-commissioned categories which include fashion, still-life, environment and life-style. In contrast the BIPP Scotland have only a single category for commissioned photography, with the other 5 categories including wedding, press and fine-art ("pictorial & illustrative").

To grossly generalise the imagery produced for the two awards, images in the AOP awards tend to be more highly designed and conceptual. In comparison the images produced for the BIPP tend to be slightly more functional and traditional. For example the finalists of the AOP's "Commissioned Advertising Singles":

    <img class="col half" src="AOP-2015-2.jpg"/>

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col half" src="AOP-2015-3.jpg"/>
    <img class="col half" src="AOP-2015-4.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

In comparison here are the finalists in the BIPP Scotland "Industrial, Commercial, Advertising & Architecture" category:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col half" src="BIPP-Scotland-1.jpg"/>
    <img class="col half" src="BIPP-Scotland-2.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col half" src="BIPP-Scotland-3.jpg"/>
    <img class="col half" src="BIPP-Scotland-5.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

The difference in aesthetic and style between the two sets of images is not large, a more comprehensive overview of the awards would be required to illustrate the point. However, it is suggested here that the AOP Awards do tend to favour more conceptual images which push the boundaries of the profession. In comparison the BIPP Awards often produce images which are high quality but slightly more conservative, holding to more traditional categories such as wedding, fine-art etc.

### Production & Evaluation

The criteria for my BIPP Scotland Student Award submission was to produce an image which meets professional standards, is interesting and engaging, but which is also less conceptual and perhaps more traditional - reflecting more the aesthetic and style of the BIPP.

I have chosen a portrait, taken from a series of images promoting wearable technology. In this particular image (below) the model is wearing a virtual reality headset.

Virtual reality headsets are often pictured in place, over the user's face. However this can be problematic both because it is predictable and also because the headset obscures the subject's face. Additionally, because virtual reality headsets are currently strongly associated with computer gaming, the user is often a white male.

</div>

In the submitted image the subject is a young woman. This adds a new element to the image because the viewer immediately starts asking why such a person should be wearing a VR headset. Virtual reality does have more uses cases than computer gaming: for example it is used by architects as a method of viewing architectural designs. The subject in this image happens to be one of these architects. This particular use-case is not explicitly or even implicitly suggested by the image; however the combination of the unusual subject and the VR headset does suggest an alternative context for VR, or at least leads the viewer to question why the subject should be wearing such a device.

The image also contains a sense of brightness and optimism, which could be taken as suggesting that current technological developments may have a positive, enabling effect for humanity.

#### Possible Improvements

* Unless the viewer is familiar with virtual reality headsets it may not be at first apparent what the device is. This could be resolved by adding in additional technological signifiers, or by making the device's branding clearer. However perhaps this ambiguity is not actually a bad thing?
* Related to the above point, as an image it may be stronger if placed within a series of images all dealing with wearable technology. This would create a broader context within which the image could be interpreted. This was actually the original intention of the project from which the image originated.
* The subject's ear ring could push the style too far towards fashion - which was never intended. The subject is meant to be a "normal" young female, but not a model. Perhaps removing the ear ring would avoid this problem. However doing so might lessen the sense of unexpectedness and contradiction in the image.
